# Cabinet UI Shim
Written in AutoHotKey v1.1.25.01 (for simplicity) (even though AHK is garbage)

First argument is the working directory of the game, second is the game executable. Any after that are passed to the game.

The default hotkey for closing the game is "f", mapped to the button on the left side of the cabinet.
